\section*{Abstract}

Analytic sets form an often overlooked but nontheless very useful field of study. 
Their history teaches us about how mistakes lead to new discoveries and their current uses show how wanting to prove someone wrong can lead to important results in many different areas of mathematics. 

Analytic sets will be introduced as continuous images of Polish spaces. 
We will work towards an understanding of their nature, especially concerning differences and commonalities with Borel sets.

A main objective of this thesis will be a  proof of the fact that there exist Analytic sets which are not Borel. 
Further time will be spent on the measurability properties of Analytic sets and different frameworks in which they appear.
